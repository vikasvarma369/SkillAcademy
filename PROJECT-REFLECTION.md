#  From Broken to Better – SkillAcademy  

One year ago, I built my first full-stack LMS project — **SkillAcademy**.  
I added it to my resume and shared it proudly...

But deep down, I knew — it wasn’t perfect.

---

Recently, I opened it again after several months of learning and growth.

**And guess what?**  
It broke.

---

I panicked, then watched random YouTube videos and tried every possible way just to run the project — somehow, anyhow.

Deployed it again.  
Deleted.  
Fixed.  
Broke it again.

This time, I didn’t pause my studies or learning path — **I kept learning new concepts while fixing this project on the side**.
I tried to fix it, but I kept running into errors.
I felt like I was going in circles, trying to patch things up without really understanding what was going wrong.
I was frustrated, but I refused to give up.
I kept pushing through, determined to make it work.
But something interesting happened along the way...

Errors that once looked scary started to make sense.  
One by one, I began to understand *why* something was failing — not just how to fix it.

With every small fix, my confidence grew.  
I wasn’t just patching the project — I was improving my understanding.

##  What I Fixed and Improved

-  **Database connection & security upgrades**  
-  Removed outdated **Google Authentication** (due to unstable behavior & password visibility bug)  
-  Solved **deployment & crash-related issues**  
-  Implemented a proper **Light/Dark mode toggle** for better user experience  
-  Refined **UI design** for a cleaner and fully responsive layout

If you've ever broken your own project and decided to face it head-on instead of abandoning it — you're already one step ahead. ✨
